Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is an evolution of the ideas behind agile software delivery. With its roots in test-driven development, domain-driven design, and automated acceptance testing, BDD focuses on the ways an application is expected to work - its behaviour.

Understanding your domain and who your stakeholders are, identifying and exploring requirements, automating acceptance criteria, and delivering working and tested software.

BDD is writing software that matters

## BDD concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outside-in           | understand system usage from the outside (user interfaces) inwards                                                                                                                                                      |
| Pull based system    | Produce only that which is ready to be used by people, systems, or code closer to a boundary or UI                                                                                                                      |
| Multiple stakeholder | Core and incidental stakeholders - Core stakeholders define the vision and often provide budget; Incidental stakeholders support the solution delivery and may influence that solution                                  |
| Multiple scale       | BDD applied from end to end, from small feature set to enterprise projects                                                                                                                                              |
| High automation      | Automation of testing (acceptance & unit) hence reducing the expense of scenario and examples testing; Enabling and inviting change through acceptance tests and reducing the impact of change                          |
| Features             | A slice through the whole solution; defined by multiple scenarios describing interactions stemming from user interface (outside-in). Features are defined with respect to business value                                |
| Feature Injection    | Only work on features that deliver value, according to the project vision/goals (in the context of the organisations goals)                                                                                             |
| Ubiquitous language  | Using the language of the domain consistently, end to end in the solution artefacts; name things with respect to their behavior in the domain. Using Given,When,Then also provides structure to the ubiquitous language |
