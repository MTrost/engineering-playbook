# GitHub Workflows and Actions

A [GitHub workflow](workflows/) defines one or more jobs to carry out as part of a continuous integration run.

Workflows are [triggered by events](trigger-events.md), usually bit Git related actions (commit, PR, etc.) or by schedule or human interaction with the GitHub website.

[GitHub Actions](actions.md) provide common jobs that can be used within a workflow, greatly reducing the configuration required to get tasks done.
